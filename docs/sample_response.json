There will be rolling hills, some climbs, and rocky trails, so you will need sturdy shoes and water. The hike course is designed so that hikers of all abilities from aggressive to leisurely can get the challenge level they desire. We usually have several trained AMC leaders present (Some may not be on Meetup) so we can split into multiple smaller groups by pace as necessary for ability and group management. All groups hike about 2 hours covering different distances from 5 to 7 miles.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Location: During the summer we meet at the Artillerly Park parking lot located oon East Inner Line Drive. (GPS 40.093825,-75.448934) Directions from 202 North or South: Get onto 4222 West. Take exit onto Route 23 and make a left into the park. Continue to follow 23 past Washington\u2019s Headquarters and make a left onto Gulph Road and then take the second right onto East Inner Line Drive. East Inner Line Drive is a 2-way road directly to the parking area despit what your GPS says. Follow same directions if you are coming East bound on 422 (from Collegeville area), except you will make a right onto Rt 23 to follow into park. We start circle-up and depart at 6:30 PM. We suggest you arrive at 6:15 if you want totalk with your friends which may be hike at a different pace. Dogs permitted \u2013 park rules require a leash at all times. You may need to walk at the back of your group. Optional after hike get together.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Although sign up is not necessary please consider signing up on MeetUp.

We can reach the farthest trails in French Creek at this distance. This hike is rated &quot;vigorous&quot; only because of the length. It is not geared to be a workout hike. We will take time to stop for breaks at the top of hills and as needed to keep the group together.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Expect less than 2000 feet total elevation gain the whole hike.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The starting location is at the French Creek State Park Playground. This is 800 feet southwest of the Hopewell Lake boat ramp parking area going towards the park office. The GPS coordinates for the playground are: 40.1983077435609,-75.79114511944678. Modern bathrooms at the start. We meet there at 9:00 AM and leave soon after. We normally finish about 30 minutes before the stated end time.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Bring water plus a snack if desired. We will stop to de-layer once we start moving. I have only limited text and talking cell phone coverage in the park at the start.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>I only cancel this hike due to adverse weather conditions which make it unsafe to drive or hike. Check Meetup comments. I&#39;ll update the AMC database status too.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Well behaved dogs can come on this hike if they can keep up with the group. Owners of dogs not on leashes will be asked to leave the hike. Please post a Meetup comment in advance if you are planning to bring your pet.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>On-line registration in the AMC system is not required for this hike; While I find Meetup convenient, I welcome and reserve spaces for AMC members from the Outdoor Connector website (go to http://activities.outdoors.org/ ) (Meetup is: https://www.meetup.com/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-Delaware-Valley-Chapter/ ). Update your RSVPs if your plans change. All participants will need to agree to and sign a paper AMC legal waver sheet just prior to the hike if you did not register on-line in the AMC Outdoor Connector.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><em>Please note:<\/em><\/p><p><em>In order to comply with Pennsylvania Youth Protection Laws, all children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian.

No containers though, Follow the red trail (it should be dry) to the PV blue trail and up the switchback to the white trail and onto the Horse Trailer Parking lot for lunch. There should be a port-a-jon there. After lunch we&#39;ll back track up the red trail to the overlook (unless there is a revolt) and make our way back to the cars. Dress appropriately, hydrate and take electrolytes if hot. Oh, and bring pruners if you want to lead as there may be a lot of briars and roses. We should have 3 - 300&#39; climbs to get the heart pumping. All participants must be 18 years or older<\/p>",

We can reach the farthest trails in French Creek at this distance. This hike is rated &quot;vigorous&quot; only because of the length. It is not geared to be a workout hike. We will take time to stop for breaks at the top of hills and as needed to keep the group together.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Expect less than 2000 feet total elevation gain the whole hike.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The starting location is at the French Creek State Park Playground. This is 800 feet southwest of the Hopewell Lake boat ramp parking area going towards the park office. The GPS coordinates for the playground are: 40.1983077435609,-75.79114511944678. Modern bathrooms at the start. We meet there at 9:00 AM and leave soon after. We normally finish about 30 minutes before the stated end time.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Bring water plus a snack if desired. We will stop to de-layer once we start moving. I have only limited text and talking cell phone coverage in the park at the start.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>I only cancel this hike due to adverse weather conditions which make it unsafe to drive or hike. Check Meetup comments. I&#39;ll update the AMC database status too.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Well behaved dogs can come on this hike if they can keep up with the group. Owners of dogs not on leashes will be asked to leave the hike. Please post a Meetup comment in advance if you are planning to bring your pet.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>On-line registration in the AMC system is not required for this hike; While I find Meetup convenient, I welcome and reserve spaces for AMC members from the Outdoor Connector website (go to http://activities.outdoors.org/ ) (Meetup is: https://www.meetup.com/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-Delaware-Valley-Chapter/ ). Update your RSVPs if your plans change. All participants will need to agree to and sign a paper AMC legal waver sheet just prior to the hike if you did not register on-line in the AMC Outdoor Connector.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><em>Please note:<\/em><\/p><p><em>In order to comply with Pennsylvania Youth Protection Laws, all children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian.

Modern bathrooms at the start. We meet there at 9:00 AM and leave soon after. We normally finish about 30 minutes before the stated end time.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Bring water plus a snack if desired. We will stop to de-layer once we start moving. I have only limited text and talking cell phone coverage in the park at the start.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>I only cancel this hike due to adverse weather conditions which make it unsafe to drive or hike.

We walk established trails and wide gravel/paved paths, mostly along the Phoenixville Canal. We will head into downtown Phoenixville on some evenings.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Location<\/p><p>The meeting place for this hike is at GPS coordinates 40.129247, -75.483021. The street address is 987 Port Providence Road, Phoenixville, PA 19460. Some maps have &quot;Port Province Trail Head - Schuylkill River Trail.&quot; There is a bathroom at the parking area we use. We leave shortly after 6:30 PM.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Notes<\/p><p>On-line registration in the AMC system is not required for this hike; While I find Meetup convenient, I welcome and reserve spaces for AMC members from the Outdoor Connector website (go to https://activities.outdoors.org/ .) (Meetup is: https://www.meetup.com/Appalachian-Mountain-Club-Delaware-Valley-Chapter/ ). Update your RSVPs if your plans change. All participants will need to agree to and sign a paper AMC legal waver sheet just prior to the hike unless you register on the AMC Outdoor Connector site.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Please update your RSVP when your plans change since I will try to limit the group size to around 18 using waitlists in Meetups. You may be pulled in to &quot;Going&quot; the day of the hike, so take your name off the waitlist too if you decide not to go. If you are unable to cancel in Meetup, just Meetup message me or leave a comment, Thanks!<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Dogs on a leash are allowed. Please tell the group in advance using Meetup comments.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Please note:<\/p><p>In order to comply with Pennsylvania Youth Protection Laws, all children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian.
